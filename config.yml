# Repository setup
# The following section template information for the repository
# This will be used when the repository is crated for each individual learner

template:
  name: # the name of the repository when it is created for the learner
  repo: # the name of the template repository from which to clone for the learner

# `before` block
# Actions to take place after the learner registers, but before they start interacting with their repo

before:
- type: # the type of action, full list at https://lab.github.com/docs/actions/
  # some actions require additional options, those should appear below `type:`
  # you can execute multiple actions in the `before` block

# Steps for the course
# A list of steps that take the learner through the course
# Create one step for each action that a learner will complete

steps:
# Step 1: Create project Repo using toolstart-jupyter template 
- title: # Create a new tool Repository From a template
  description: # Use toolstart-jupyter to begin your tool
  event: # the event that will trigger the actions to be executed, full list at https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/
  actions: # a list of the actions that will occur when the step is triggered by an event
  - type: # the type of action, full list at https://lab.github.com/docs/actions

# Step 2: Clone to nanoHUB
# - title: # Clone repo to nanoHUB
#  description: # Clone repo to nanoHUB the workspace
#  event: # the event that will trigger the actions to be executed, full list at https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/
#  actions: # a list of the actions that will occur when the step is triggered by an event
#  - type: # the type of action, full list at https://lab.github.com/docs/actions

# Step 3: Use nanoHUB jypyter notebook tool
# - title: # Use jypyter notebook tool to commit changes
#  description: # Open the notebook on nanohub, make some changes then commit
#  event: # the event that will trigger the actions to be executed, full list at https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/
#  actions: # a list of the actions that will occur when the step is triggered by an event
#  - type: # the type of action, full list at https://lab.github.com/docs/actions

# Step 4: Create a tool page
# - title: # the title of the step, shown to the learner in the course progress page
#  description: # a description of the step, shown to the learner in the course progress page
#  event: # the event that will trigger the actions to be executed, full list at https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/
#  actions: # a list of the actions that will occur when the step is triggered by an event
#  - type: # the type of action, full list at https://lab.github.com/docs/actions

# Step 5: Install tool as prototype
# - title: # the title of the step, shown to the learner in the course progress page
#  description: # a description of the step, shown to the learner in the course progress page
#  event: # the event that will trigger the actions to be executed, full list at https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/
